# Serverless TODO

To implement this project, you need to implement a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. Search for all comments starting with the `TODO:` in the code to find the placeholders that you need to implement.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# My Solution

Auth -> AuthO cert by way of JSONkeys
